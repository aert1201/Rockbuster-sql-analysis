# Rockbuster SQL Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Rockbuster’s global film rental data to support strategic decision-making. The objective was to evaluate revenue performance, customer behavior, geographic distribution, and catalog effectiveness in order to identify growth opportunities and operational improvements.

Rockbuster operates in 108 countries, but revenue generation is concentrated within a smaller group of high-performing markets.

## Business Questions

This analysis addresses the following key management questions:

- Which movies generate the most and least revenue?
- What is the average rental duration across the catalog?
- Where are Rockbuster customers located globally?
- Which regions contain high-value customers?
- How does revenue vary across geographic markets?
- Which film categories contribute most to total revenue?
- Are pricing, rental duration, and replacement costs stable?

## Key Insights

- Revenue is highly concentrated geographically. While Rockbuster serves customers in 108 countries, India, China, and the United States generate the largest share of total revenue.
- Customer concentration does not always equal revenue dominance. Some regions with fewer customers produce strong revenue through higher spending behavior.
- High-value customers are geographically dispersed across multiple countries and cities.
- Film revenue is uneven across titles. A small number of films generate a disproportionate share of revenue, while a large portion of the catalog contributes little or none.
- Revenue concentration varies significantly by film category. Sports, Sci-Fi, Animation, and Drama consistently generate higher total revenue.
- Rental pricing, duration, and replacement cost metrics remain stable, supporting predictable revenue patterns.

## Strategic Recommendations

- Prioritize investment in high-revenue film categories.
- Optimize the film catalog by reassessing low- and zero-revenue titles.
- Leverage high-value customer insights for targeted engagement strategies.
- Apply region- and category-specific marketing approaches.
- Use data-driven insights to guide expansion into promising markets.
